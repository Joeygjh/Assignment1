<!--DESIGN PROCESS--!>
I choose to design in a modern way for aesthetic purposes. My website focus is companies that are interested in me and wants to hire me into their companies. They are looking for someone that can help them improve on their company and they require manpower to do so. They will look for someone with qualifications and certifications to show that they are experienced and is suitable for the job. My website shows different certifications and qualification, as well as what I can provide them if I am able to join their company.
